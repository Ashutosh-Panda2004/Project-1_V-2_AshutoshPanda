- **Notifications and Alerts**: Implement weather alerts to notify users of severe weather conditions in their tracked cities via in-app notifications or email alerts.
- **Offline Functionality**: Utilize service workers to enable offline access, allowing the application to function without an active internet connection by caching essential data and resources.
- **Multi-Language Support Expansion**: Expand language support beyond English, Spanish, and French to cater to a broader audience.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop native mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms using frameworks like React Native.
- **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize performance by implementing code splitting and image optimization techniques.
- **Advanced Search Filters**: Enable users to filter cities based on specific weather conditions or proximity to their current location.
